12 MW Small Scale Mini Hydel Power Project by M/S Balaji Energy Pvt. Ltd
_____________
Scale of the project activity Small Scale 

Project participants Creduce Technologies Private Limited (Representator) 
M/s. Balaji Energy Pvt. Ltd. (Project Proponent) 

Host Party India 

Applied methodologies and standardized 
baselines 

Applied Baseline Methodology: 
AMS-I.D: “Grid connected renewable electricity 
generation”, version 18 
 
Standardized Methodology: Not Applicable. 
Sectoral scopes 01 Energy industries 
(Renewable/Non-Renewable Sources) 
____________
The net generated electricity from the project activity is sold to the respective state electricity board 
i.e., Andhra Pradesh under the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) signed between the PP and the 
Andhra Pradesh Transmission Corporation (APTRANSCO). In pre-project scenario, electricity 
delivered to the grid by the project activity would have otherwise been generated by the operation of 
fossil fuel-based grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new fossil fuel-based generation 
sources in the grid. The electricity produced by the project is directly contributing to climate change 
mitigation by reducing the anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere by 
displacing an equivalent amount of power at grid. 
Hence, project activity is displacing the estimated annual net electricity generation i.e., 42,048 MWh 
from the Indian grid system, which otherwise would have been generated by the operation of fossil 
fuel-based grid-connected power plants. The estimated annual CO2e emission reductions by the 
project activity are expected to be 37,843 tCO2e. 
The estimated annual average and the total CO2e emission reductions by the project activity is 
expected to be 37,843 tCO2e, whereas actual emission reduction achieved during the first CoU period 
shall be submitted as a part of first monitoring and verification. 
Since the project activity will generate electricity through hydro energy, a clean renewable energy 
source it will not cause any negative impact on the environment and thereby contributes to climate 
change mitigation efforts.
